            <h1>Security Engineering</h1>
        </header>
        <h3>Purposes</h3>
        <p>Security engineering is the practice of designing and implementing security measures to protect systems, networks, and applications from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction.</p>
        <p> The purpose of security engineering is to ensure that security is integrated into the design and development of systems, rather than being an afterthought or add-on. By incorporating security engineering principles, organizations can create more secure systems that are resilient to cyber attacks.</p>
        <h3>Principles</h3>
        These are principles we can use in this field:
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Defence in Depth:</h4><p>Implementing multiple layers of security controls to provide redundancy and minimize the impact of a single point of failure.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Least Privilege:</h4><p>Granting users and systems the minimum level of access necessary to perform their functions, to minimize the risk of privilege escalation.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Seperation of Duties:</h4><p> Separating critical functions and ensuring that no one person or system has complete control over them, to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Fail-safe Defaults:</h4><p>Designing systems with secure defaults, so that even if configuration errors or vulnerabilities are present, the system remains secure.</p></li>
         </ol>
        <h3>Techniques:</h3>
        These are the techniques used in this field:
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Cryptography:</h4><p>Using cryptographic algorithms and protocols to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Access Control:</h4><p>Implementing access controls to limit access to sensitive information and resources, and ensure that access is granted based on the principle of least privilege.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Vulnerability Mangement:</h4><p>Identifying and remediating vulnerabilities in systems, networks, and applications to reduce the risk of exploitation.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Secure Coding Practices:</h4><p>Writing secure code that is resistant to common vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, injection attacks, and cross-site scripting.</p></li>
        </ol>
