        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Aside from the technology involved, the scope of cyber security also constitutes smartness 
            in taking the right cyber-defense decisions. Typically, strong cyber security implies multiple
            layers of protection to data with encryption.</p> 
        <p>It is essential to be aware of the different types of cyber security packages that are available
            at one's disposal in order to enable sound judgment when it comes to choosing one. Listed below 
            are some of the types of cyber security packages that one can consider:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li><h4>Critical Infrastructure Security : </h4><p>This type is found in applications that contain 
                cyber-physical systems like water purification systems or electricity grids.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Application Security : </h5><p>This cyber security type (found in antivirus or firewall) implements
                both software and hardware to fight the threats that appear during the development stage of an application.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Network Security : </h4><p>It secures the infrastructure behind the design like a two-factor authentication process 
                to protect internal networks from intruders.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Data Loss Prevention : </h4><p>It is concerned with the processes and policies for the prevention 
                of data loss and includes data storage policies and network permissions.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Information Security : </h4><p>Also known as InfoSec, this type of cybersecurity type protects both 
                online and offline data from unauthorized access, disclosure, deletion, or any other form of malicious intent.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Cloud Security : </h4><p>This software-based tool prevents data corruption and addresses risks 
                against on-premise threats.</p></li>
            <li><h4>End-user Education : </h4><p>End-user education involves training and educating the end-users and 
                the general masses on the best practices to use when dealing with the internet and the online world.</p></li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Different Types of Cyber Threats</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><h4>Attacks on Confidentiality : </h4><p>These attacks target personal identification information like 
                bank account information and card details. </p></li>
            <li><h4>Attacks on Integrity : </h4><p>Also known as leaks, these attacks are designed to sabotage businesses or 
                personal identities. It involves releasing sensitive information to build mistrust in you.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Attacks on Availability : </h4><p>This modern-day extortion blocks one from accessing their own data until 
                a ransom is paid.</p></li>										
          </ol>
          <p>The above three categories encompass all types of cyber-attacks like social engineering, 
            Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), malware, ransomware, and others.</p>

        <h2>Importance of Cyber Security</h2>
        <p>Due to the increased exposure to information on the internet, cybercrime has become one of the more rapidly 
            increasing crimes. While devices and networks are getting disrupted on a larger scale, stopping identity theft 
            isn't the only objective. The protection of data integrity is equally critical.</p>
        <p>Cybercriminals are becoming more and more sophisticated, and it is important to understand their change in target, 
            their methods, and their impact on organizations. Since the danger lurks for anyone who uses the internet, 
            cyber security has inevitably become an integral part of our system.</p>

            <h2>Scope of Cyber Security</h2>
        </header>
        <h4>The scope of cyber security in the future can be determined by several factors. Let's take a look!</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Shortage of Cyber Security Professionals : </h4><p>Cyber security professionals around the world are at risk
                of not being sufficiently prepared to battle the issues that are existent in cyber security. According to the 
                Worldwide Information Security Workforce Study (GISWS), over 19,000 cyber security professionals around the world 
                are insufficient laborers to overcome cyber security difficulties.
                In India, the requirement for cyber security professionals by 2022 is 1.8 million. Evidently, this current shortage of 
                cyber security professionals in the country will lead to more job openings in the near future.
            </p></li>
            <li><h4>Partially Skilled Professionals : </h4><p>Many organizations are still in need of highly skilled staff and a responsive workforce. 
                Security professionals have expressed their difficulty and their lack of expertise to address cyber security issues. Professionals 
                must therefore get certified and acquire more skills and competencies so that they can easily respond to cyber security threats and risks.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Global Demand : </h4><p>There are a high demand for Operations and Security Management professionals worldwide. On the other hand, 
                Incident and Threat Management positions are most popular in the Latin American region with a demand of 63%. The Middle East and Africa 
                have a demand of 65% more for Incident and Threat Management experts than some other positions.
                Despite constant endeavors by organizations to hire for various positions, the current pattern remains the same thereby, 
                significantly expanding the number of experts who will positively impact cyber security globally.
            </p></li>
            <li><h4>High Pay : </h4><p>Cyber security is one of the best options for any job seeker or professional who is looking to move up the career ladder as 
                it has an abundance of top-paying jobs as well as job security.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Unlimited Growth : </h4><p>Initially, security groups were the “handymen” types, but now they rise to fame in crime scene investigations, 
                episode reactions, and application security. With the consistent growth in the cybersecurity domain, there is development potential in both 
                your professional and learning curve. For a cybersecurity professional, learning never stops.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Cyber Security Jobs in the Future: </h4><p>Cyber Security professionals will get the opportunity to work on advancements and frameworks. 
                Cybersecurity will be applicable across various industries from robots to websites. In this way, these experts will get to serve a vast 
                number of clients making cyber security a promising career prospect. 
                Because of the range of abilities that these cyber security experts have while managing all current security challenges, they will 
                always be high in demand.
