            <h1>Identity and Access Management</h1>
        </header>
        <h3>Purposes:</h3>
        <p>
            Identity and access management (IAM) is the practice of managing user identities and 
            controlling their access to systems, networks, and applications. The purpose of IAM is
             to ensure that only authorized individuals or systems can access resources and information,
              and to monitor and manage access to those resources. By implementing effective IAM processes and
               technologies, organizations can improve their security posture, reduce the risk of data breaches, and
                ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
        </p>
        <h3>Principles:</h3>
        <ol>
            The principles of IAM provide guidance on how to manage user identities and control access to resources. Some of the key principles include:
            <li><h4>Authentication:</h4><p>Verifying the identity of users and systems before allowing access to resources.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Authorization:</h4><p>Determining what resources a user or system is authorized to access based on their role and permissions.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Accountability:</h4><p>Logging and monitoring user activity to detect unauthorized access or suspicious behavior.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Federation:</h4><p>Enabling users to access resources across multiple systems and networks using a single set of credentials.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Lifecycle Management:</h4><p>Managing user identities and access throughout their lifecycle, including provisioning, de-provisioning, and access review.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Techniques:</h3>
        IAM involves the use of various techniques to manage user identities and access, including:
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Signle Sign-on(SSO):</h4><P>Allowing users to access multiple systems and applications using a single set of credentials.</P></li>
            <li><h4>Multi-Factor Authentication(MFA):</h4><P>Requiring users to provide additional forms of authentication, such as a fingerprint or one-time password, in addition to their username and password.</P></li>
            <li><h4>Role-based Access Control(RBAC):</h4><p> Assigning access permissions based on a user's role within the organization.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Privileged Access Management(PAM):</h4><p>Managing and monitoring access to privileged accounts, which have elevated permissions and can access sensitive information and resources.</p></li>
      </ol>
