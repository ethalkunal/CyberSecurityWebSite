        <h3>Purposes:</h3>
        <p>
            Communication and network security is the practice of protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of 
            information as it is transmitted over a network. The purpose of communication and network security is to ensure that 
            information is not intercepted, modified, or disrupted during transmission. By implementing effective communication and
            network security measures, organizations can protect sensitive information and maintain the trust of their customers, partners, and stakeholders.
        </p>
        <h3>Principles:</h3>
        The principles of communication and network security provide guidance on how to protect information during transmission. Some of the key principles include:
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Confidetial:</h4><p>Ensuring that information is kept confidential and only accessible to authorized individuals or systems.</p></li>
            <li><h4>integrity:</h4><p>Ensuring that information is not modified or tampered with during transmission.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Availability:</h4><p>Ensuring that information is available to authorized individuals or systems when needed.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Authentication:</h4><p>Verifying the identity of individuals or systems before allowing access to information or resources</p></li>
            <li><h4>Non-Repudiation:</h4><p>Ensuring that the sender of information cannot deny having sent it, and the receiver cannot deny having received it.</p></li>
         </ol>
         <h3>Techniques:</h3>
         Communication and network security involves the use of various techniques to protect information during transmission, including:
         <ol>
            <li><h4>Encryption:</h4><p>Using encryption algorithms to protect information from interception and unauthorized access.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Access Controls:</h4><p>Implementing access controls to limit access to information and resources to authorized individuals or systems.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Firewalls:</h4><p>Implementing firewalls to block unauthorized access to networks and systems.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Intrusion detection and prevention:</h4><P>Using intrusion detection and prevention systems to identify and prevent unauthorized access to networks and systems.</P></li>
   </ol>
