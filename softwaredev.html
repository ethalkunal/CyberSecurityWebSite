        <h3>Purposes:</h3>
        <p>
            Software development security is the practice of integrating security measures into the software development lifecycle (SDLC) to ensure that software applications are designed, developed, and maintained with security in mind. The purpose of software development security is to minimize the risk of security vulnerabilities in software applications, and to ensure that security is built into the development process from the beginning. By implementing secure software development practices, organizations can reduce the risk of data breaches, cyber attacks, and other security incidents. 
        </p>
        <h3>Principles:</h3>
        The principles of software development security provide guidance on how to design, develop, and maintain secure software applications. Some of the key principles include:
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Secure Coding:</h4><p>Writing secure code that is resistant to common vulnerabilities, such as injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS), and buffer overflows.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Threat Modelling:</h4><p>Identifying potential security threats and vulnerabilities early in the development process, and designing software applications to mitigate these risks.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Security Testing:</h4><p>Conducting security testing throughout the development process to identify and address security vulnerabilities.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Secure Configuration Management:</h4><p>Managing software configuration in a secure manner to minimize the risk of unauthorized access and other security incidents.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Secure Software Deployment:</h4><p>Ensuring that software applications are deployed in a secure manner that minimizes the risk of security incidents.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Techniques</h3>
        Software development security involves the use of various techniques to design, develop, and maintain secure software applications, including:
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Code Review:</h4><p>Reviewing code to identify potential security vulnerabilities and ensure that secure coding practices are being followed.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Static Analysis:</h4><p>Using automated tools to analyze source code for security vulnerabilities.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Dynamic Analysis:</h4><p>Testing software applications in a runtime environment to identify potential security vulnerabilities.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Secure Coding Libraries and Frameworks:</h4><p>Using secure coding libraries and frameworks to minimize the risk of security vulnerabilities.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Secure DevOps:</h4><p>Integrating security into the DevOps process to ensure that security is built into the development process from the beginning.</p></li>
