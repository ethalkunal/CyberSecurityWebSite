        <h3>Purposes</h3>
        <p>Risk management is important as it aims to protect an orgranization from potential losses or threat to its operations.
            The risks include financial losses, reputation damage to the organization or any harm to the employees.</p>
        <p>
            Risk mangement is different for every organization as per every their needs and requirements.
            It's very important to have a risk management plan as it helps to reduce the chances
            of something going wrong and minimize the damage if something goes wrong.
        </p>
        <h3>Principles</h3>
        <p>These are five principles of risk management as below:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Risk identification:</h4><p>This is the process of identifying potential risks to an organization.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Risk Analysis:</h4><p>It is assessing the likelihood and impact of those identified risks.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Risk Control:</h4><p>It involves taking steps to communicate minimize, or eliminate the impact of potential risks.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Risk Financing:</h4><p>This is the process of allocating financial resources to cover the costs associated with potential risks.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Claims Management:</h4><p> This is the process of dealing with any claims that may arise as a result of a risk.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Types of Security and Risk Management</h2>
        Below are the different types of security and risk management used by various organizations:
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Risk Acceptance:</h4><p>Here the organization accepts the risk associated with a particular situation. Using this kind of risk management the
                 company recognizes that it is not worth the cost and effort to mitigate the events due to the risk.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Risk Transferance:</h4><p>Here the organization shifts the risk to another party through insurance. When an individual or organization gets an insurance the financial risk associated with the event is transfered with the insurance company.
            <li><h4>Risk Avoidance:</h4><p>Here the company mitigates risks by not involing the risky activities or situations.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Risk Reduction:</h4><p>Here the individual or organizatin takes steps or methods to reduce the impact of a risk, this combines with risk acceptance as it accepts tehe risks associated and also reduce the loss from spreading.</p></li>
            </p></li>
            <li><h4>Risk Sharing:</h4><p>This method removes the burden of problematic events to one department and shares it with others those who can help and provide support to control the risk and the problems.</p></li>
