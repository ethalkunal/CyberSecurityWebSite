            <h1>Security Operations</h1>
        </header>
        <h3>Purposes:</h3>
        <p>Security operations is the practice of monitoring, detecting, and responding to security threats and incidents in an organization's environment. The purpose of security operations is to protect an organization's information assets and systems by identifying and mitigating threats, minimizing the impact of security incidents, and maintaining business continuity. By implementing effective security operations processes and technologies, organizations can improve their security posture and reduce the risk of cyber attacks, data breaches, and other security incidents.</p>
        <h3>Principles:</h3>
        The principles of security operations provide guidance on how to manage security threats and incidents. Some of the key principles include:
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Threat Detection:</h4><p>Identifying and detecting security threats in an organization's environment, such as malware infections, suspicious network activity, and phishing attacks.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Incident Response:</h4><p>Responding to security incidents in a timely and effective manner to contain the threat and minimize the impact on the organization.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Log Management:</h4><p>Collecting, storing, and analyzing log data from various sources to detect security threats and incidents.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Continous Mangement:</h4><p>Monitoring an organization's environment on a continuous basis to identify and mitigate security threats and incidents.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Business Continuity:</h4><p>Ensuring that critical business operations can continue in the event of a security incident or other disruption.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Techniques</h3>
        <ol>
            <Li><h4>Security information and Event Management(SIEM):</h4><p>Collecting, storing, and analyzing log data from various sources to identify security threats and incidents.</p></Li>
            <li><h4>Endpoint Detection and Response(EDR):</h4><p>Monitoring and detecting security threats on endpoint devices such as laptops and mobile devices.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Network Traffice Analysis:</h4><p>Analyzing network traffic to identify suspicious activity and potential security threats.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Threat Intelligence:</h4><p>Collecting and analyzing information about emerging security threats and trends to better protect an organization's environment.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Security Orchestration, automation, and Response(SOAR):</h4><p>Automating security operations processes to improve efficiency and effectiveness, and enable faster incident response.</p></li>
